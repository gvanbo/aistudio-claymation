## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Option 1: Feature Flag Rollout (Recommended)
```typescript
const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  useEnhancedPrompts: true,
  enableQualityPresets: true,
  enableBackgroundControl: true,
  enableIndividualCharacterPrompts: true
};
```

### Option 2: Gradual Migration
1. Deploy enhanced components alongside existing
2. A/B test new features
3. Migrate users based on feedback

## 📊 Key Improvements

### Prompt Quality
- **Before**: Simple concatenation of style + description + pose
- **After**: Structured markdown format with critical instructions and quality specifications

### Educational Focus
- **Before**: General-purpose character generation
- **After**: Specifically optimized for educational materials with print/online presets

### Multi-Character Scenes
- **Before**: Global scene description
- **After**: Individual character control + scene interaction + height relationships

### Output Flexibility
- **Before**: Fixed JPEG output
- **After**: PNG/JPEG with quality levels and background options

## 🎨 Best Practices Adopted

### From cartoon-character-generator
1. **Structured Prompts**: Clear sections and critical instructions
2. **Background Control**: Explicit transparent/illustrated options
3. **PNG Support**: Better for educational transparency needs
4. **Individual Control**: Separate inputs for each character

### From aistudio-claymation
1. **Rich Character Data**: Detailed descriptions and pose libraries
2. **Height Calculations**: Sophisticated multi-character scaling
